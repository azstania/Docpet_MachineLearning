Architectur model: Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow, which is designed for image recognition and classification

Libraries:
1. os: This module provides an interface for interacting with the operating system.
2. cv2 (OpenCV): OpenCV is an image processing and computer vision library that provides various functions for reading, writing, and manipulating images.
3. numpy: Numpy is a library for numerical computing that provides support for array and matrix operations.
4. zipfile: to work with zip files, it used to extract the contents of a zip file.
5. random: This module is used to generate random numbers.
6. shutil: This module provides functions for various operations on files and directories, such as copying or deleting.
7. tensorflow (tf): TensorFlow is an open-source library for machine learning and deep learning that is often used in developing neural networks models.
8. ImageDataGenerator: This class from TensorFlow is used to build image augmentation data generators that can be used to increase the variety of training data.
9. img_to_array, load_img: These functions from TensorFlow.keras.preprocessing.image are used to convert an image to a NumPy array and load an image from a file, respectively.
10. copyfile: This function of shutil is used to copy files from one location to another location.
11. matplotlib.pyplot: Matplotlib is used to create data visualizations, and pyplot provides functions for creating plots.
